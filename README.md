Sonic Racing Transformed GdGohan Edition

UPDATE ([@20excal07](https://github.com/20excal07)):

First off, I wanna thank @GdGohan himself for having gone through the trouble of making this awesome game work on modern devices, he's done an excellent job on this. Keep it up (if there's any more to be done) :p

I'm writing this guide more as a way to guide people in the right direction on choosing which APK and which OBB to use it with, because the current description on how to get them is, well, a bit of a mess. It doesn't really help that the contents of the Google Drive is also kind of all over the place and confusing to navigate around for the average layperson looking to give this game a shot.

Note that this guide will NOT be teaching you on how or where to put the OBB files in your phone, there are plenty of other resources for this. Here's a good one from Reddit that I personally recommend following:
- **[r/Android: Managing files in the "Android/data" folder on Android 11 (without root or USB)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/j3zgmm/managing_files_in_the_androiddata_folder_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**

Okay, now on to the actual guide. All the links posted below will be based on the V4 releases, unless otherwise noted.

## Which OBB file to use?
- `851.4 MB` **[(RECOMMENDED) Click here if you want to experience the game in it's mostly vanilla form.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLCkQzGSewLm0Wt-w9rZ9Txh1YK5GCAq?usp=drive_link)** This is the way to experience the game as the original devs intended.
- `974.6 MB` **[Click here if you want a modded experience](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BoP8IRHxzz91omFqe5AZMqUUE8UTdOLA?usp=drive_link)**, courtesy of @GdGohan . This replaces the Musics with their original soundtracks with high quality (instead of their remixes), and also alters the way the Main Menu and the on-screen HUD looks.
   - `+ 129.4 MB` **[(OPTIONAL) Include this along with the main OBB](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1147NnpxYH7hvpUYTTP4m9kfgL0Mvh_Gj?usp=drive_link)** if you want the original SASRT opening video and Intel trailer to play at launch.
- `564.8 MB (LITE)` **[Click here if you're tight on storage space.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15peZ8hVWslCla0a9GQIkWzUgH1D1G3_e?usp=drive_link)** This is essentially the same as the vanilla OBB above, although I assume the music quality is further compressed to save space.

## Which APK to install?
For this section, I'll list multiple links for each given scenario. Start from the top-most link (the best version), then try the next one if the APK didn't work for you.

If you are using the Lite OBB, then you'll need the Lite variants of the APK, otherwise just use the normal ones.

### Note that if you want proper gamepad support, you MUST use the ones that I'll mark below with a ðŸŽ® emoji.

- If your device's display doesn't have a notch, and has rectangular corners:
   - Normal variants:
      - ðŸŽ® **[v4.2d (based on v545632)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15uCQ0OPPRP8aDz4fREYa03muy_NgK4QP/view?usp=drive_link)**
      - **[v4d (based on v534439)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qm9kVl0-msOSyG45hDTbFKsiThNt5XG/view?usp=drive_link)**
      - **[v4 (based on v531960)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QlEv6_yjv0R27yDAfo-FL4sAvn1TOofP/view?usp=drive_link)**
   - Lite variants:
        - ðŸŽ® **[Lite v4.2c (based on v545632)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccFEdWLuOf1It0_WCANi9ZEOw6E1c8_p/view?usp=drive_link)**
        - **[Lite v4c (based on v534439)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cZbPY--csmt00_LUbC1EDJlAirN7lsTR/view?usp=drive_link)**
        - **[Lite v4 (based on v531960)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18-A05iwfDwrPQMV9z3A1nM1ZZHPYy5r9/view?usp=drive_link)**

- If your device's display has a notch and/or has rounded corners:
<sup>(You're welcome to ignore this and just use the ones already listed above, but I highly recommend you use these for an optimal experience.)</sup>
   - Normal variants:
       - ðŸŽ® **[v4.2c Smaller UI (based on v545632)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cTSTrAD5Q2lf1LSBGpKJH-iD8upZ4bi2/view?usp=drive_link)**
       - **[v4c Smaller UI (based on v534439)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cXLr7mwcmuqxeV7WpNfyLsXY78BwreiI/view?usp=drive_link)**
   - Lite variants:
       - ðŸŽ® **[v4.2 Smaller layout (based on v545632)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18RLPWRwrrXT-0nWKlqJFNw0RjM9CAonO/view?usp=drive_link)**
       - **[v4b Smaller layout (based on v534439)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ExwmTfgo-0ejdYBoNU9CeNWKmQXjVPj/view?usp=drive_link)**

Hope this is useful to someone! I just wanted to post this somewhere people can see.

UPDATE V4:
Apk for all GPUs, using Mali obb (use obb from v4, is the most updated. The difference between GPU types in the game is only related to textures, and the textures in the Mali version uses ETC1, which supports any device from Android 4+, with any GPU)

V4.2B:
the game will reboot once after setting your name. It only works with the achievement section.

When starting the tutorial, 
wait a few seconds until the black screen no 
longer appears, just in case, check if the game 
has sound while waiting.

â€¢What changed in this version:

--V530506/V530620/V531178/V531960/V534439/V545632--

-Greater compatibility with newer devices 

and larger screens

(possibility, considering that it loaded normally 

on my cell phone)

-support for new android

(tested on moto g7 play android 13 LineageOS),

It's not a guarantee, but it's a good alternative 

because it's a different version (even if it's old) 

APK V1/V2:

-Forced game to load in 16:9 aspect ratio (Go to Settings > display > full screen apps and disable the game's full screen function)

Recommended DPI: 360 

Step 1.(Go to Settings > About Phone, tap on the â€˜Build Numberâ€™ 5 to 6 times continuously until you see the â€˜Youâ€™re a developer nowâ€™ notification.)

Step 2.(Go to System > Developer Options, find the option â€˜Smallest Widthâ€™ and enter the 360 value). Make sure to note down the default value so that you can restore it back.

-Bug fixed:Buttons not showing

-supports different obb, just edit the apk code 

and adapt it to load the obb 

(This is already possible in unmodified/

original apk)

-Custom Audio

check audio type: https://katiefrogs.github.io/vgmstream-web/

Wwise 2013:https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3234

Recommended audio db = 3 to 4.5

Music: loop=0, stream=1 and vorbis encode

Audio(sfx): loop=0, stream=0/1 and ADPCM encode

Voice: loop=0, stream=0 and ADPCM encode

(experimental) HxD editor:https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20

(Voice) Best Choice for editing (backup the .pck file before): https://smacktalks.org/forums/topic/79306-released-sound-editor%C2%A0version-2101/

alternative (Sound Editor 2018):https://smacktalks.org/forums/topic/68040-sound-editor-2018-released-version-141/page/12/

and to listen to the audios + check id: https://www.nexusmods.com/mafiadefinitiveedition/mods/98

Voice:

Possible solutions/Not working: 

1. use Ringing Bloom to open and export the .pck, open the new .pck in FusionTools and export again, and make changes to the file using HxD

2. 	Ravioli Scanner: https://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm#ravioli_download (working)

    FusionTools: wem id 0 = Ravioli Scanner: File0012

    File size < or = to the original

3.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools or Ravioli Explorer and create new pck with it

4.  Sound Editor (working) StreamsEng.pck only

(To use the other streams .pck + soundbanks in the Sound Editor):

5.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools or Ravioli Explorer (it may not work..... YES, YOU BETTER EXTRACT IT ONE BY ONE ðŸ’€ IN FUSIONTOOLS, IT'S THE SAFEST WAY), export 2428910049.bnk and 1051509953.bnk using HxD Editor or Ravioli Explorer (recommended) and create new pck with Sound Editor 2017/18 or Sound Editor 2.1.0.1 (working)

    Voice = wem and Sfx = bnk

    or Voice = wem + bnk

5,1. Modify with HxD Editor the default.pck file from the "Sound Editor/templates" folder, replace all code (make backup before):
