Sonic Racing Transformed GdGohan Edition

â€¢What changed in this version:

--V531960--

-Greater compatibility with newer devices 

and larger screens

(possibility, considering that it loaded normally 

on my cell phone)

-support for new android

(tested on moto g7 play android 13 LineageOS),

It's not a guarantee, but it's a good alternative 

because it's a different version (even if it's old) 

-Forced game to load in 16:9 aspect ratio (Go to settings > display > full screen apps and disable the game's full screen function)

(Bug fixed:Buttons not showing)

-supports different obb, just edit the apk code 

and adapt it to load the obb 

(This is already possible in unmodified/

original apk)

    FusionTools: wem id 0 = Ravioli Scanner: File0012

    File size < or = to the original

3.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools and create new pck with it

4.  Sound Editor (working) StreamsEng.pck only

(To use the other streams .pck in the Sound Editor):

5.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools and create new pck with Sound Editor 2017/18 or Sound Editor 2.1.0.1 (working)
