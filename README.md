Sonic Racing Transformed GdGohan Edition

â€¢What changed in this version:

--V531960--

-Greater compatibility with newer devices 

and larger screens

(possibility, considering that it loaded normally 

on my cell phone)

-support for new android

(tested on moto g7 play android 13 LineageOS),

It's not a guarantee, but it's a good alternative 

because it's a different version (even if it's old) 

-Forced game to load in 16:9 aspect ratio (Go to settings > display > full screen apps and disable the game's full screen function)

(Bug fixed:Buttons not showing)

-supports different obb, just edit the apk code 

and adapt it to load the obb 

(This is already possible in unmodified/

original apk)

Possible solutions/Not working: 

1. use Ringing Bloom to open and export the .pck, open the new .pck in FusionTools and export again, and make changes to the file using HxD

2. 	Ravioli Scanner: https://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm#ravioli_download (working/maybe)

    FusionTools: wem id 0 = Ravioli Scanner: File0012

    File size < or = to the original

3.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools and create new pck with it
