Sonic Racing Transformed GdGohan Edition

â€¢What changed in this version:

--V531960--

-Greater compatibility with newer devices 

and larger screens

(possibility, considering that it loaded normally 

on my cell phone)

-support for new android

(tested on moto g7 play android 13 LineageOS),

It's not a guarantee, but it's a good alternative 

because it's a different version (even if it's old) 

-Forced game to load in 16:9 aspect ratio

(Bug fixed:Buttons not showing)

-supports different obb, just edit the apk code 

-Custom Audio
Wwise 2013:https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3234
configuration: volume=3db, stream=1 and vorbis encode

and adapt it to load the obb 

(This is already possible in unmodified/

original apk)
