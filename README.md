Sonic Racing Transformed GdGohan Edition

UPDATE V4:
Apk for all GPUs, using Mali obb

When starting the tutorial, 
wait a few seconds until the black screen no 
longer appears, just in case, check if the game 
has sound while waiting. Fixed only in adreno v2 folder

•What changed in this version:

--V530506/V530620/V531178/V531960/V534439/V545632--

-Greater compatibility with newer devices 

and larger screens

(possibility, considering that it loaded normally 

on my cell phone)

-support for new android

(tested on moto g7 play android 13 LineageOS),

It's not a guarantee, but it's a good alternative 

because it's a different version (even if it's old) 

APK V1/V2:

-Forced game to load in 16:9 aspect ratio (Go to Settings > display > full screen apps and disable the game's full screen function)

Recommended DPI: 360 

Step 1.(Go to Settings > About Phone, tap on the ‘Build Number’ 5 to 6 times continuously until you see the ‘You’re a developer now’ notification.)

Step 2.(Go to System > Developer Options, find the option ‘Smallest Width’ and enter the 360 value). Make sure to note down the default value so that you can restore it back.

-Bug fixed:Buttons not showing

-supports different obb, just edit the apk code 

and adapt it to load the obb 

(This is already possible in unmodified/

original apk)

-Custom Audio

Possible solutions/Not working: 

1. use Ringing Bloom to open and export the .pck, open the new .pck in FusionTools and export again, and make changes to the file using HxD

2. 	Ravioli Scanner: https://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm#ravioli_download (working)

    FusionTools: wem id 0 = Ravioli Scanner: File0012

    File size < or = to the original

3.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools and create new pck with it

4.  Sound Editor (working) StreamsEng.pck only

(To use the other streams .pck + soundbanks in the Sound Editor):

5.  export all wem and bnk files using FusionTools, export 2428910049.bnk and 1051509953.bnk using HxD Editor and create new pck with Sound Editor 2017/18 or Sound Editor 2.1.0.1 (working)

    Voice = wem and Sfx = bnk

    or Voice = wem + bnk

5,1. Modify with HxD Editor the default.pck file from the "Sound Editor/templates" folder, replace all code (make backup before):
